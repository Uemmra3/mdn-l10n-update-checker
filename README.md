https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/mdn-l10n-update-checker/

This is a Firefox add-on that notify the reader of MDN Web Docs if the localized version of the page is older than the original(en-US).

Once you logged in to MDN, you can watch any English page or subpages to get the latest information. This is good if you know which page to watch.
But MDN has so many pages and you may feel you can't follow everything!! So this add-on will help you know whether the localized page you are looking is updated.

When viewing a MDN Web Docs page that needs to update, editor UI is highlighted as below!!
